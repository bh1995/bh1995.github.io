"cognizant2023": "Since joining Cognizant I have worked on two projects. My first project I had the role of Senior Spark developer where my team and I helped a client in the public transportation industry migrate an Informatica data platform to a Azure Databricks based platform. <br> As a senior developer I was responsible for understanding all business logic in Informatica and translating that into solutions using Spark, SQL and Azure Data Factory. <br> The final solution utilized a data lakehouse framework with non-curated, curated and clean layers to form a kimball based data model. <br> The project followed agile principles using two week long sprints, tracked the project using JIRA. The team integrated the project with Github utilizing a Trunk-based branching, and automated testing using Github actions.<br>",

"dtu": "I like mathematics and coding so studying combination at DTU was a no brainer for me. I focused my studies around machine learning and statistics. During my time I completed pretty much every machine/ deep learning course available at DTU. Due to the strict lockdowns on campus during COVID I decided to study over full time and complete my program a semester early.",
"hyu": "Had a great experience at Hanyang University as an exchange student! Here I studied Advanced Thermodynamics, Advanced Structural Mechanics, Numerical Analysis aswell as Vector Calculus.<br> In my free time I trained at the university judo club, ate all kinds of delicious Korean food and visited cosy traditional towns and villages around the country.",
"liu": "My studies here were focused on energy technology. At this small univeristy located in the middle of the cosy forrests of Sm√•land, Sweden I fell in love with engineering as a discipline. I also learned how interesting coding and mathematics is."
